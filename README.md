# Clustering-FAA-Aircraft-Incident-with-K-Means
Clustering FAA Aircraft Incident from 2010 - 2015 using K-Means Algorithm and Python Language

I used K-Means Clustering to find the relation between Pilot International Certification and their Total Flight Time (Hrs). This is because there are many pilots who got high flight certificates, while their total flight time have not meet the certificate standards. So many accidents happen in Amerika because the pilots who drive the plane do not meet the standard.
